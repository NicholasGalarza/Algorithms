/*
 * 3.3 Stack of Plates
 * Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack
 * gets too high, it might topple. Therefore, in real
 * life, we would likely start a new stack when the
 * previous stack exceeds soe composed of several 
 * stacks and should create a new stack once the
 * previous one exceeds capacity. SetOfStacks.push()
 * and SetOfStacks.pop() should behave identically
 * to a single stack.
 * 
 * FOLLOW UP
 * Implement a function popAt(int idx) which performs
 * a pop operation on a specific sub-stack.
